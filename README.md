This repo is to collect all codes during learning and daily using python, especially important algorithms and newly-upgrated characteristics of python.

Every codes here might be not finished, sometimes just because I have already solve the oringinal problem, otherwise it means stucked in theoretical or logic problems.

While meeting tough problems, there will be annotations in codes.
